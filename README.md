## Over view of the Project 

## Project Explanation on domain of Java Programming dataset 

## Objective
The objective of this program is to develop a simple, efficient system for tracking and managing student grades across different subjects or assignments. The program aims to enhance understanding of core Java concepts, such as arrays or lists for data storage, loops for repeated operations, and control structures for decision-making. It also provides insight into how to calculate averages and convert numerical grades to letter grades or GPA equivalents. The goal is to create a user-friendly experience while reinforcing key programming skills and ensuring accurate output.

## Key Activities 
User Input:
The user provides the number of subjects and the corresponding grades.
Grade Storage:
Grades are stored in an array to facilitate calculations.
Average Calculation:
The program calculates the average by summing all grades and dividing by the number of subjects.
Letter Grade Assignment:
Conditional statements assign a letter grade based on the calculated average.
GPA Calculation:
A helper method calculates the GPA using the letter grade.
Output Display:
The program displays the average, letter grade, and GPA to the user.

## Key Insights
Developing a student grade tracker provides insights into handling collections like arrays, which allow efficient data storage and management. It demonstrates the importance of loops for processing multiple inputs and performing calculations. The program reinforces conditional logic by mapping numerical grades to letter grades and GPA values. Additionally, using helper methods promotes modular code design, improving maintainability and readability. This project also emphasizes the need for user input validation and resource management by closing the Scanner after use.

## Key functions 
Scanner Class for Input Handling:
Used to collect user input for grades and the number of subjects.

Arrays or Lists for Data Storage:
An array or list holds the grades, facilitating repeated operations and calculations.

Loops (for or while):
A loop allows the program to repeatedly prompt the user to input grades for each subject.

Arithmetic Operations for Calculations:
The program calculates the average grade by summing all input grades and dividing by the number of entries.

Conditional Statements (if-else):
Used to determine the letter grade or GPA based on the calculated average.

## Technologies used 
Programming Language: Java
Scanner Class: For collecting user input.
Arrays: To store and manage grades.
Loops: To handle repeated input collection and calculations.
If-else Statements: For assigning letter grades based on average.
Methods: For modular code design (e.g., calculateGPA).
